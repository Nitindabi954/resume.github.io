# Resume WebPage Using HTML and CSS

A single web page resume has done purely in HTML and CSS, Which can be rendered into PDF through web browser print to pdf functionality.
As the résumé is purely typeset with HTML and CSS, it's highly customizable (e.g. if you want an "objective" section, just copy-paste a few HTML elements) and does not require proprietary software. All you need is a text editor and a web browser.

In This Project, I am using Visual studio code for editing the html and css files

## Installation

Use the Microsoft Visual Studio Code as an editor [VS CODE](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) to install Visual Studio Code.

```bash
Install Microsoft Visual Studio Code
Then Install HTML Snippets inside the Visual studio code
Go to visual_studio_code -> Extension -> search HTML Snippet -> click install

Then install Html CSS Support inside the Visual studio code
Go to Visual_studio_code -> Extension -> search Html Css Support -> click install
```
## How to Run the Html And CSS file
```
Once you finished the installation process, you have to run the html and css files
so follow the process
Create a folder on the desktop
and then put both files (HTML AND CSS) in that folder with dot extension 
(LIKE Resume.html and Resume.css)
If You added any type of image that one is also stored in that folder

after completing all the above steps, Just open the HTML file any of your installed browsers.

And don't forget to store all the files in one folder otherwise your program will not run properly
```
